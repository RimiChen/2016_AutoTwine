# AutoTwine
---------
This project would like to try to extend Twine with some Procedural Content Generation functions. Since some content and story links are generated automatically, this project is nameed AutoTwine. This is for the course project of CSC791 [Generative Methods of Game Design](https://sites.google.com/a/ncsu.edu/generative-methods-f16/) 2016 Fall, in NCSU. 


##Original Tool & Background
Twine is a opensource for telling interactive, nonlinear stories. It supports users to create story passage, and links between them hence to generate story branches.

- Here is the original repository of Twine at BitBucket: https://bitbucket.org/klembot/twinejs
- Here is the original website of Twine: https://twinery.org/

Twine is under GNU General Public License.

I migrated the original codes from BitBucket to Github, just because I am used to use Github.
